# Very Friendly Game Engine

This project aims to port some of the engine-like features of my other projects
into a standalone TypeScript game engine.

# Development

Run `npm run start` to start a server at `localhost:3000`. In a separate
session, run `npm run build` to start watching the TypeScript files for
changes. Then, in another separate session, run `npm run bundle` to have
browserify automatically detect changes as well.
